#!/bin/sh
# verus/make/headers.sh [PORT_ROOT]: hold a port's copies of the kit's
# Verus files to the kit's text (`make verus-headers`,
# verus/make/proved-port.mk). Vendored from wolfi-dev/proved-port's
# kit/make by kit/sync.sh, which copies beside it, under
# verus/make/templates/, the templates kit/make/VERUS-FILES names, each
# with `.tmpl` added to its name (verus/FLOOR.tmpl), as they are at the
# kit commit verus/count/KIT records: verus/FLOOR, RLIMIT,
# REACH, MINTS and count.toml, .chainguard/ci/verus.yaml, miri.yaml and
# .chainguard/reviewers.yaml, and .chainguard/review-prompt.md. The kit's
# other templates (conformance, consumers, fuzz, test, lint, the
# environments, develop.yaml, deps.yaml) are starting points the port
# reshapes, and this does not hold them. The vendored copies themselves
# (verus/count, verus/make) are kit/sync.sh --check's.
#
# For each of those templates the port has (one it lacks is skipped and
# named), the header is the file's leading `#` comment lines up to its
# `# kit:` line. The port's header must hold the template's text, where
# each placeholder (`{NAME}`, `{NAME: guidance}`, `{Guidance}`) stands for
# any text the port fills in, and a placeholder that fills whole lines
# (a list item, a sentence of its own) may be deleted with its lines. The
# comparison ignores white space and the `#` that starts each line, so a
# filled placeholder may rewrap its paragraph. Comment lines the port
# adds after its `# kit:` line are its own.
#
# .chainguard/review-prompt.md is Markdown, with no `#` header: the port's
# prompt must hold, anywhere and ignoring white space, the template's
# vendored-kit rule, its `- The vendored kit` list item, which says how
# verus/count, verus/make and KIT may change. It carries no kit line.
#
# VERUS_FLOOR (from the environment, as proved-port.mk passes it; a path
# under PORT_ROOT, default verus/FLOOR) is the port's ratchet file, which
# the verus/FLOOR template's header holds (chainz: verus/SHARES).
#
# The port's `# kit: proved-port VERSION` line must name the commit
# verus/count/KIT records (in full or a prefix of 7 or more characters),
# or its tag: the headers are the kit's text at that version. VERSION is
# one word, or the templates' `vX.Y.Z (SHA)` form, where SHA names that
# commit as above and vX.Y.Z is its tag; when the commit has no tag (a
# copy taken between releases) vX.Y.Z is the release before it, which
# KIT does not record, so any vX.Y.Z passes.
#
# Exit 0: every header matches; 1: one drifted or a file is missing; 2:
# usage.
