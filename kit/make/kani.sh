# verus/make/kani.sh [--list] [ARGS]: the Kani harnesses (`make kani`,
# verus/make/proved-port.mk), vendored from wolfi-dev/proved-port's
# kit/make by kit/sync.sh. Run it from the port's root. ARGS go to every
# `cargo kani` call, the `cargo kani list` that finds the harnesses too
# (before `list`, as KANI_FLAGS do), so `--features quantum8` lists the
# harnesses that feature gates.
#
# It runs every harness of the selected crates, one `cargo kani` call a
# crate, or one harness, or one shard of them, and fails when any call
# fails, when KANI_FAIL_PATTERN appears in a call's output, or when the
# selection leaves nothing to run. --list prints the harnesses instead,
# one `CRATE NAME FILE` a line, from `cargo kani list` (CRATE is `-` for
# cargo's default package selection, FILE the source file the list
# keys the harness by, from the workspace root). A harness is its name
# and its file: crates of cargo's default selection can each have a
# `tests::check`, and kani.sh counts, lists and shards each. It first
# runs `cargo fetch --locked`, since cargo kani takes no --locked.
#
# Nothing to run is a failure even where cargo kani would pass: cargo
# kani exits 0 on a crate with no harnesses, so before a run of every
# harness kani.sh lists them, and fails when the selected crates have
# none. A port with no harnesses yet declares so with KANI_NONE = yes in
# its Makefile, so its kani checks run from its first commit: kani.sh
# then lists the harnesses, passes when there are none, and fails when
# there are any (the declaration is stale, delete it so they run). An
# empty selection with no declaration still fails.
#
# The environment says what to run; empty is the same as unset:
#
#   KANI_CRATES        the packages with harnesses, each run with -p;
#                      empty runs cargo's default selection, no -p
#   KANI_ONLY          one crate of KANI_CRATES alone (pcre3's unicode half)
#   KANI_EXCLUDE       every crate of KANI_CRATES but this one (the rest)
#   KANI_HARNESS       one harness (Kani's --harness, which matches a
#                      substring of the full name) of the one selected
#                      crate: chainz's foreach of KANI_ONLY and KANI_HARNESS
#   KANI_SHARDS        split every harness of the selected crates into
#   KANI_SHARD         this many shards and run shard KANI_SHARD (1 to
#                      KANI_SHARDS) of them, each by its full name
#                      (--exact); shard 0 prints the split and runs
#                      nothing. Every shard splits them the same way.
#                      Harnesses of one name in several files of cargo's
#                      default selection go to one shard, since its
#                      --harness NAME runs all of them.
#   KANI_WEIGHTS       a file of `NAME SECONDS [alone]` rows, `#` lines
#                      comments (challoc's ci/kani-regular.sh table, NAME
#                      the full name `--list` prints) that the split balances
#                      by, longest first, each to the shard with the least
#                      time so far; a harness marked alone gets a shard of
#                      its own, from shard 1 up (they must leave a shard
#                      for the rest, or kani.sh exits 2), and one not
#                      listed counts as 2 seconds; a NAME's row weighs
#                      each harness of that name
#   KANI_FLAGS         flags for every cargo kani call, before `list` too
#                      (challoc: -Z unstable-options -Z stubbing
#                      -Z mem-predicates --ignore-global-asm, its features)
#   KANI_LIST_FLAGS    flags after `list` (challoc: -Z stubbing
#                      -Z mem-predicates)
#   KANI_JOBS          harnesses at once (-j); Kani takes -j only with
#                      terse output, so it implies --output-format terse
#   KANI_FORMAT        --output-format (terse, regular)
#   KANI_CBMC_ARGS     --cbmc-args, last (challoc: --verbosity 9)
#   KANI_FAIL_PATTERN  a grep -E pattern that fails a call whose output
#                      has it (challoc: `warning: ignoring`, CBMC leaving
#                      a bool comparison unconstrained). With it set, each
#                      call's output goes to target/kani/<crate>.log and
#                      only the per-harness lines are printed, with the
#                      log's tail on a failure.
#   KANI_VERSION       the release `cargo kani --version` must name
#   KANI_NONE          `yes`: the port has no harnesses yet, and a run
#                      passes only while that holds (above); any other
#                      value exits 2, and so does `yes` with KANI_HARNESS
#                      or KANI_SHARD, which pick harnesses
#
# Exit 0: every harness run verified, or KANI_NONE=yes and there are
# none; 1: one did not, nothing ran, or KANI_NONE=yes and there are some;
# 2: usage.
